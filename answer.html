    <p> At first you try and stay focused but the knocking becomes extremely loud. You jump up to answer and a pile of bones are laying infront of the door. You remember that Seth had the bones to show his brother and you wonder how they got here. </p>

<p> You decide to kick them and send them flying into the wall to show that you are not scared. You turn around to see the phrase "You should have not done that" being scratched into multiple places at the same time including the wall and your computer screen. You are then knocked out by an object that you do not know about and wake up in a void. You are now alone and suffering the consequences of not letting a spirit rest.
<p> The End. </p>
