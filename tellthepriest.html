    <p>The priest laughs at you. Why would he not? Whatever it is that is haunting you, it found out and it is angry. You wake up one morning to a message written in red on the wall that reads "Either you find the bones and put them back or suffer the consequences."  </p>

    <p> Part of you thinks whatever is communicating is bluffing but you must communicate with whatever it is. The only things you know of is a medium your aunt knows or an ouija game you bought years ago but have not opened. </p>
