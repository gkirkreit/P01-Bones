    <p>The priest listens seriously to what the medium tells him and becomes worried. The priest explains that he wants to bless the house you are living in but as he finishes his sentence you all hear a loud eerie creek. </p>

<p> This puts you all at ease and suddenly you hear pots and pans dropping downstairs. The priest explains that we must hurry and perform the blessing before someone gets injured. The lights get shut off but you light and carry the two candles on your desk as well as using your phone's flashlight. Each time the priest blesses a room the house becomes more quiet even though several windows have been shattered as well as furniture torn up and broken. The Priest completes his blessing and all is quiet. Damage has been done but we only got minor scratches. </p>

<p> The End. </p>
