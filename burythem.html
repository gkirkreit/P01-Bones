    <p>You listen closely to what the medium says and remember that the bones are at your friends house. You give your friend Seth a call and explain what is going on he comes over. He is slightly bummed because Seth thought the bones were a really cool find in my backyard but agreed to bury them with me. </p>

<p> As we dig the hole the medium leaves and I thank her. We talk for a bit as we dig the large hole and begin putting the bones back and as we put on the last shovel we get the chills and hear a moan sound come in and fade away. </p>
<p> The End. </p>
